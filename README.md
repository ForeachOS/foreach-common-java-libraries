Foreach Java Common Libraries
=============================

About
-----

The Foreach Java Common Libraries is a set of different Java libraries (JAR) files that contain
a number of useful, reusable classes (like utilities or base classes).  They are not tied into any
business libraries but are meant to be more generic for Java based projects.

Vaguely inspired by Apache Commons.
